# RoR Ebook Eshop playground

Hey, this is my playground creating a demo of e-commerce site where you can:
- list & manage e-content items for sale (eg ebooks)
- create order & pay through Payu integration
- download the ebook directly or send to an email

Things to sort out:
* [ ] test of pay controller with payu mock
* [ ] Dibuk integration for Ruby https://github.com/dibukeu/client-php
