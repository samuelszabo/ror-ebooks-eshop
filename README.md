# RoR Ebook Eshop playground

Hey, this is my playground creating a demo of e-commerce site where you can:
- list & manage e-content items for sale (eg ebooks)
- create order & pay through Payu integration
- download the ebook directly or send to an email

Things to sort out:
* [ ] Orders::show - user has right?
* [ ] OrderItems::show - user has right?
* [ ] refeactor Dibuk implementation - separate concern, or something..
* [ ] test of pay controller with payu mock
